# tee-iam

The TEE-IAM tool provides an identity and access management (IAM) solution for applications deployed within an Intel SGX Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). This tool is designed to integrate with existing TEE-based infrastructure, enabling secure management of users, roles, permissions, and audit capabilities.

## Features
Identity Management: Securely manage user identities within a TEE, ensuring that only authenticated users gain access to sensitive resources.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define and assign roles to users with specific permissions tailored to their operational needs.
Policy Enforcement: Enforce security policies within the TEE environment to restrict unauthorized actions.
Audit Logging: Track access and actions within the TEE to support security audits and compliance requirements.
Secure API: RESTful API for managing identities and access controls with encrypted communication channels.
TEE-Specific Enhancements: Leverages TEE features to ensure integrity and confidentiality of IAM operations.


## Requirements:

TEE Support: Ensure the platform supports Intel SGX.

## Docker Build:

```
git clone https://github.com/trustup/tee-iam.git
cd tee-iam
./build.sh
```


## Security
The TEE-IAM tool takes advantage of TEE capabilities to ensure security and integrity:

* Data Encryption: Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) is encrypted within the TEE.
* Attestation: Supports remote attestation to verify the integrity of the TEE-IAM environment.
* Audit and Logging: Logs are signed and stored within a secure enclave to prevent tampering.
